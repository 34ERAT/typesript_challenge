This repository contains my solutions and progress from various **TypeScript coding challenges**. These exercises were completed to help reinforce my learning and sharpen my skills in TypeScript.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Practice core TypeScript concepts.
- Improve problem-solving skills using TypeScript.
- Document my learning journey in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/34ERAT/typesript_challenge.git](https://github.com/34ERAT/typesript_challenge.git)

    ```
3.  **Install `tsx` (if you don't have it globally or as a dev dependency):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g tsx
    # or if you prefer it as a dev dependency for the project:
    npm install --save-dev tsx
    ```
4.  **To run a specific TypeScript file:**
    ```bash
    npx tsx your_challenge_file.ts
    ```
    (Replace `your_challenge_file.ts` with the actual file name, e.g., `challenge1.ts`)
